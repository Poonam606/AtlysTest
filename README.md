##CarouselView
A SwiftUI carousel component powered by an MVVM-style CarouselViewModel. This lightweight library provides a smooth, interactive card carousel with drag gestures, depth effects, and customizable sizing.

##Features

MVVM architecture: Business logic extracted into CarouselViewModel.
Dynamic sizing: Cards scale to fit available space while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio.
Depth & layering: Scale, opacity, and z-index adjust based on card position.
Smooth gestures: Drag-to-swipe with resistance at edges, velocity and threshold detection.
Page indicators: Animated dots reflect the current card.
